# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


## brief description
 I choose Dribbble.com site hero section as my design, I choose Dribbble.com because it is full of rich features that mostly seen in modern web sites. and also good balance of colors and smoothness. 

 To implement these features used react framework with tailwind.css and also used custom animation to obtain some look and feel same as the design. and also used third-party libraries such as react-multi-carousel, and also buld re-usable component to make development easy.

## installation 
 use npm package manager to install all the dependencies.
 ***checkout to the `develop` branch and run the following command***
 `npm install`

## to run the project 
use the command 
`npm run dev`
